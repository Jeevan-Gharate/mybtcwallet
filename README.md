# mybtcwallet
I want to clarify that the BTC wallet in question was originally shared during a partnership with a group of developers from Iran. At that time, I was the project owner, but the wallet used for business purposes was never uniquely assigned for the business.

As of now, I am no longer affiliated with that wallet in any way. It continues to be used by the Iranian developers, and I have received multiple complaints related to it, despite having disassociated myself from it over a year ago.

Please refrain from sending me direct messages with inquiries about this wallet. The developers have completely cut off communication with me, and I am currently making efforts to re-establish contact to learn more about their recent activities involving the wallet.
